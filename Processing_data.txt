The purpose of this part of the task is to analyze the raw microbiome sequencing data and acquire the bacterial counts in each sample.

The requirements:
Paired-end fastq files for each sample

Data format for each sample:
Forward fastq: xxxx_R1_001.fastq
Reverse fastq: xxxx_R2_001.fastq

The way the files should be kept:
All the fastq files should be demultiplexed and stored in one folder
The folder may be uploaded to the server in zipped format

Subsampling:(Optional)
Users can subsample a certain number of reads from each sample to reduce the data volume
They can do it using seqtk tool which is available here:
https://github.com/lh3/seqtk

Does it need anything else?
No, everything else is already in the server

Generate bacterial counts table:
The pre-loaded scripts can give the following results:
1) How many sequences in each sample had at the beginning and how many remained at each of the processing step
1) The sequences of each Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) in fasta format
2) The bacterial count table for all the samples combined
3) The taxonomies (upto genus or species level) of each ASV based on Silva Database v.132
